Description


In the SpaceX API Challenge I have replicating, kind of, the SpaceX website, but a lighter version of it. This project includes big players like ReactJS, GraphQL and Apollo. I have work with things like Routing, Components, Hooks, Queries and some others. And this is my  first challenge :)

If you have problems with opening the application you can see it in this link that I put live: https://rinorzekolli-spacex-project.netlify.app/
